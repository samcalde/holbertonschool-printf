DESCRIPTION                                                                                      
       Print ARGUMENT(s) according to FORMAT, or execute according to format specifiers.  

Arguments must be passed to the function in the order of appearance in the format.

If a non-existent format specifier is used, it will be printed literally, with the percentage symbol, followed by the character.                   
                                               
                                                                                                 
       FORMAT controls the output as in C printf.
